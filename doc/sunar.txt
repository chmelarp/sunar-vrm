Abstract

  In brief, SUNAR is composed of three basic modules â€“ video processing, retrieval 
and the monitoring interface. Computer Vision Modules are based on the OpenCV Library 
for object tracking extended by feature extraction and network communication 
capability similar to MPEG-7. Information about objects and the area under surveillance 
is cleaned, integrated, indexed and stored in Video Retrieval Modules. They are based 
on the PostgreSQL database extended to be capable of similarity and spatio-temporal 
information retrieval, which is necessary both for overlapping and non-overlapping surveillance camera 
system as well as information analysis and mining in a global context [1].
